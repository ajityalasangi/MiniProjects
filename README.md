# TypeScript Mini Projects – Learning & Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of mini TypeScript projects that I built while improving my skills in **OOP, TypeScript, design patterns, clean code**, and **backend architecture**.  
Each project focuses on one core concept and is designed to strengthen my fundamentals as a **future full-stack web developer**.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repo is to:

- Improve my TypeScript skills through consistent practice  
- Build real-world logic using classes, interfaces, generics, and OOP  
- Understand project structure and clean architecture  
- Create small but meaningful modules that prepare me for larger full-stack applications  
- Track my daily progress publicly on GitHub

This repository grows as I learn more every day.
